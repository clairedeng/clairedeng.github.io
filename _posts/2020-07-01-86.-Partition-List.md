Given a linked list and a value $x$, partition it such that all nodes less than $x$ come before nodes greater than or equal to $x$.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.



Example:

> General
>
> Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
>
> Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5
>
> 
>
> Empty Linked List
>
> Input: head = [], x = 0
>
> Output: []
>
> 
>
> 1 Linked List
>
> Input: head = 1, x = 2
>
> Output: 1
>
>  
>
> Head
>
> Input: head = 2->1, x = 2
>
> Output: 1->2
>
> 
>
> Change in order
>
> Input: head = 3->1->2, x = 3
>
> Output: 1->2->3



My solution:

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode partition(ListNode head, int x) {
        if(head == null) return head;
        int nextLarge = x;
        boolean found = false;
        ListNode node = new ListNode(0, head); //create a new linked list with 0 as head to prevent the change in the head
        ListNode copy = node; // point start at the new head
        //start loop to find the first node that has its next node greater or equal to x, break the loop once found it
        while(node.next != null) {
            if(node.next.val >= x && found == false) {
                found = true;
                nextLarge = node.next.val;
                break;
            } else {
                node = node.next;
            }
        }
        ListNode head2 = node.next; // pointer to loop the rest of the list
        // start loop to move all the nodes that less than x to the node(where we find the node) and replace the next with next.next. change node to node.next to keep order
        while(head2 != null && head2.next != null) {
            if(head2.next.val < x) { // find a node with val < x
                int v = head2.next.val; // get the value
                head2.next = head2.next.next; // remove the node
                ListNode newNode = new ListNode(v, node.next); // create a new linked list start with the node we found that less than x, connect it with node we found that first greater or equal to x.
                node.next = newNode; // add it to the node linked list. 
                node = node.next; // to keep the order of the node add
                // recheck the new head2(it's already changed)
            } else {head2 = head2.next;} // don't make any change and keep looping.
        }
        
        return copy.next; //return the new head->next
    }
}
```



Leetcode Solution:

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode partition(ListNode head, int x) {
    	//before and after are the two pointers used to create the two list
    	//before_head and after_head are used to save the heads od the two lists
        //All of these are initialized with the dummy nodes(val = 0) created.
        ListNode before_head = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode before = before_head;
        ListNode after_head = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode after = after_head;
        
        while(head != null) {
            //If the original list node is less than the given x, assign it to the before list
            if(head.val < x) {
                before.next = head;
                before = before.next;
            } else {
                //If the original list node is greater or equal to the given x, assign it to the after list
                after.next = head;
                after = after.next;
            }
            head = head.next;
        }
        after.next = null; // Last node of "after" list would also be ending node of the reformed list
        
        //Once all the nodes are correctly assigned to the two lists, combine them to form a single list which would be returned.
        before.next = after_head.next;
        return before_head.next;
    }
}
```
